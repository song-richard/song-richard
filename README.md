ExpressiveToDo is a full-stack web application designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. The application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to create new tasks, specify due dates, and view a list of their tasks. The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS for server-side rendering, providing an intuitive and responsive user experience.

On the backend, the application is powered by Node.js and Express, handling HTTP requests, serving the frontend files, and rendering dynamic views using EJS. The data is stored in a MongoDB database, and the interaction with the database is facilitated by Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.

The core functionalities include creating tasks through a form submission, storing task data in the MongoDB database, and fetching and displaying tasks dynamically on the client side. The application adopts a full-stack architecture, allowing seamless communication between the user interface, server-side logic, and the database.

ExpressiveToDo not only demonstrates proficiency in web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, EJS, and MongoDB but also showcases the integration of both frontend and backend components to create a cohesive and functional task management system.
